# Do-UK-Theme-Parks-Have-The-Worst-Queue-Times-in-Europe
This repository contains code from an analysis I performed into whether UK theme parks have the worst queue times in Europe.

When some theme park enthusiasts were making claims about UK theme parks having the worst queue times in Europe, and Merlin theme parks having worse queue times than those of other operators, I decided to empirically test those hypotheses. When I tested out whether UK theme parks have higher queue times than theme parks in other European countries, boxplots and descriptive analytics found that the UK was right up there for queue time length, being only narrowly beaten by Spain in most metrics and even topping the charts in terms of median average maximum queue time. Hypothesis testing unearthed statistically significant evidence to suggest that UK theme parks have longer queues than those of other European countries on average. When I tested out whether European Merlin theme parks have higher queue times than European theme parks operated by other operators, boxplots and descriptive statistics found that Merlin was on the higher end of European theme park operators for queue length on average, albeit Disney and PortAventura World came out higher. Hypothesis testing unearthed statistically significant evidence to suggest that European Merlin theme parks have longer queues than those of other European operators on average.

In this analysis, I performed descriptive analytics (mean and median), created data visualisations comparing queue time distributions between countries, and performed hypothesis testing to determine whether the United Kingdom had longer theme park queue times on average than other European countries and whether Merlin theme parks had longer queue times than those of other theme park operators on average.

The code for this analysis is predominantly contained within one file. This file contains all of the data visualisations, descriptive analytics and hypothesis testing performed for this analysis.
